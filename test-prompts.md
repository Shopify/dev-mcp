- Submit button that shows loading state
- Error handling and success messages
```

### **Data Display**

```
Create a reporting interface with:
- Sortable table headers
- Row selection checkboxes
- Expandable row details
- Empty state when no data
- Loading states for async data
- Pagination with page size options
```

## ðŸŽª Demo Scenarios

### **Demo 1: "Zero to App in 60 Seconds"**

```
Create a complete Shopify app for inventory management with:
1. Dashboard showing low stock alerts
2. Product list with quick edit capabilities
3. Reorder recommendations based on sales velocity
4. Settings page for notification preferences
Make it production-ready with proper navigation and error handling.
```

### **Demo 2: "Customer Service Portal"**

```
Build a customer service app featuring:
1. Ticket management interface with status tracking
2. Customer lookup with order history
3. Quick actions for common tasks (refund, reorder, update address)
4. Knowledge base search integration
5. Team collaboration features (assign, comment, escalate)
```

### **Demo 3: "Marketing Campaign Manager"**

```
Design a marketing campaign management tool with:
1. Campaign creation wizard with templates
2. Audience segmentation interface
3. Performance dashboard with key metrics
4. A/B testing setup and results
5. Integration settings for email/SMS providers
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### **Accuracy Scoring**

- **Perfect (100%)**: Generated code runs without modification
- **Excellent (90-99%)**: Minor tweaks needed (missing imports, small syntax fixes)
- **Good (80-89%)**: Component choices correct, structure needs adjustment
- **Fair (70-79%)**: Right direction but significant rework needed
- **Poor (<70%)**: Wrong components or completely off-track

### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Component Selection**: Are the right Polaris components used?
2. **Structure**: Is the component hierarchy logical and semantic?
3. **Props Usage**: Are component properties used correctly?
4. **Accessibility**: Are ARIA labels and semantic structure present?
5. **Best Practices**: Does it follow Shopify design patterns?

### **Testing Protocol**

1. Run each prompt 3 times to test consistency
2. Score each attempt using the accuracy scale
3. Document common failure patterns
4. Track improvement over time
5. A/B test with and without enhanced schema tools

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Improvement

### **Feedback Loop**

1. **Collect**: Save all generated code samples
2. **Analyze**: Identify patterns in failures
3. **Enhance**: Update schema or suggestion algorithms
4. **Validate**: Re-test with improved system
5. **Deploy**: Push improvements to production

### **Schema Enhancement Priorities**

1. **Missing Components**: Add components that are frequently needed but missing
2. **Prop Validation**: Improve property type checking and validation
3. **Composition Rules**: Better parent-child relationship modeling
4. **Usage Examples**: Add real-world usage patterns to schema
5. **Error Messages**: Improve feedback when components are misused

## ðŸš€ Usage Instructions

1. **Setup**: Ensure MCP server is running with enhanced schema tools
2. **Baseline**: Test with original tools (comment out new ones)
3. **Enhanced**: Test with full enhanced toolset
4. **Compare**: Measure accuracy improvement
5. **Iterate**: Use failures to improve schema and tools

This testing framework will help us achieve and maintain the 80% first-prompt accuracy goal while providing clear metrics for continuous improvement.
